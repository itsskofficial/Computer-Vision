    An Image Captioning project that takes an image and generates a descriptive caption using both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The project aims to provide meaningful captions for images using a combination of image processing and natural language generation techniques.

## About The Project

![Screen Shot](imgcap.png)

ImgCap is an Image Captioning project that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image processing and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for natural language generation. The goal is to generate descriptive captions for images, providing additional context and understanding.

## Built With

This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

- **pip:**

  Ensure you have Python installed, as pip comes bundled with Python distributions.

  ```sh
  # To upgrade pip to the latest version, run:
  python -m pip install --upgrade pip
  ```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/itsskofficial/computer-vision.git
   ```

2. **Enter into the directory**

   ```sh
   cd Projects/ImgCap
   ```

3. **Install pip packages**

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

ImgCap enhances image understanding by generating descriptive captions. The project uses a combination of CNN and RNN to analyze the content of images and generate meaningful captions.
