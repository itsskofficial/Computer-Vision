## About The Project

![Screen Shot](facerec.png)

FaceRec is a face recognition deep learning project that utilizes Python, Tensorflow, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Pandas. The project employs a Siamese network for accurate face recognition, offering a reliable solution for identity verification.

## Built With

This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

- **pip:**

  Ensure you have Python installed, as pip comes bundled with Python distributions.

  ```sh
  # To upgrade pip to the latest version, run:
  python -m pip install --upgrade pip
  ```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/itsskofficial/computer-vision.git
   ```

2. **Enter into the directory**

   ```sh
   cd Projects/FaceRec
   ```

3. **Install pip packages**

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

FaceRec utilizes a Siamese network for accurate face recognition. Users can input facial data, and the model will generate reliable results, making it suitable for applications such as identity verification and access control.
