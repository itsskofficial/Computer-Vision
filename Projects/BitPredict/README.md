## About The Project

![Screen Shot](bit-predict.png)

BitPredict is a Bitcoin prediction deep learning project that utilizes Python, Tensorflow, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Pandas. The project aims to predict Bitcoin prices using deep learning techniques, providing insights into potential future price movements.

## Built With

This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

* **pip:**
  
  Ensure you have Python installed, as pip comes bundled with Python distributions.

  ```sh
  # To upgrade pip to the latest version, run:
  python -m pip install --upgrade pip


### Installation

1. **Clone the repo**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/itsskofficial/Deep-Learning.git
    ```

2. **Enter into the directory**
    ```sh
    cd Projects/BitPredict
    ```

3. **Install pip packages**

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

BitPredict uses deep learning techniques to predict Bitcoin prices. Users can input historical data, and the model will generate predictions, aiding in decision-making related to Bitcoin investments.
